When you run the fetch.py in this directory, it should prompt you to
sent a few environment variables:

CACHE_DIR
TMP_DIR

You can use this script as a model of how to use the geo_api module.

If you set ENV=SERVER, then you may also specify a log file path by
setting LOGFILE. Otherwise, the log will be written to STDERR.

The cleaned data files are saved in the client script
https://github.com/andrewdyates/kun_oral_cancer_fetcher/blob/master/fetch.py

Run the script like:
$ cat my-gse-list.txt | python fetch.py 2>> mylog.txt


The important lines of code are:

# Create the GSE study object instance of "GSE" from a gse ID string
like 'GSE12345'
# =====
g = geo_api.GSE(gse_id)

# Create a filter object instance of "EQTLFilter" from a GSE study object
filt = geo_api.EQTLFilter(g)

# For each row in the filtered GSE study data, fetch a list of columns.
for row in filt.get_rows():
 fp.write("\t".join(row)); fp.write("\n")
